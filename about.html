  <p>I was born and raised in Belgium, where I attended international schools and enjoyed a number of sports including basketball, squash, cricket, and tennis. Upon high school graduation, I moved to Boston to pursue a Bachelors of Science in Finance in the Questrom School of Business. I graduated a semester early with the intention to pursue a startup. Unfortunately, our execution was not proactive and in two months no progress was made. Then, I decided to learn about my family's business in the diamond and jewellery industry - with manufacturing units in Surat and Mumbai. The video on the left animates the process. Now, having completed only two months spent training with my family, I am taking a break to retry with my startup ideas. The first step is learning how to code with Code Astra - the very place that I am currently typing this.</p>
